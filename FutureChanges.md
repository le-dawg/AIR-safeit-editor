Okay, I will analyze the codebase to identify the components and logic related to the Reflections feature and provide instructions on how to disable them. I'll start by searching for relevant keywords like "Reflections", "REFLECTIONS_QUICK_ACTION_PROMPT", and related terms to pinpoint the relevant files and code sections. Then I will provide a summary of the changes needed to disable the feature.

The codebase search results highlight several files related to "Reflections". Based on the file names and snippets, here's a breakdown of the key areas to address:

packages/shared/src/types.ts: This file defines the Reflections interface, which is the data structure for storing reflection-related information.
apps/agents/src/reflection/index.ts: This file likely contains the core logic for generating reflections using LangGraph. The reflect function seems to be the entry point for this process.
apps/agents/src/open-canvas/nodes/customAction.ts: This file likely integrates the reflections generation into the custom action node of the LangGraph graph.
apps/web/src/components/reflections-dialog/ConfirmClearDialog.tsx: This file is a UI component for confirming and clearing reflections.
apps/web/src/hooks/useStore.ts: This file might contain logic for fetching and storing reflections in the application's state.
packages/shared/src/prompts/quick-actions.ts: This file contains prompt templates related to quick actions, including reflections.
To completely disable the Reflections feature, you'll need to modify these files to remove or disable the relevant code. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Disable Reflection Generation in apps/agents/src/reflection/index.ts

Comment out or remove the entire reflect function. This will prevent the generation of new reflections.
Step 2: Remove Reflection Integration in apps/agents/src/open-canvas/nodes/customAction.ts

Modify the customAction function to remove any code that calls the reflect function or uses reflection-related prompts.
Remove the import statements for reflection-related modules and prompts.
Step 3: Remove UI Components in apps/web/src/components/reflections-dialog/ConfirmClearDialog.tsx

Remove the ConfirmClearDialog component from the codebase, or comment out its usage.
Step 4: Remove Reflection Logic in apps/web/src/hooks/useStore.ts

Remove the useStore.getReflections function or comment it out.
Remove any code that uses the Reflections interface or stores reflection data in the application's state.
Step 5: Remove Reflection Prompts in packages/shared/src/prompts/quick-actions.ts

Remove or comment out the REFLECTIONS_QUICK_ACTION_PROMPT constant.
Step 6: Remove the Reflections interface in packages/shared/src/types.ts

Remove the Reflections interface.
By following these steps, you should be able to completely disable the Reflections feature in the codebase, including both the backend logic and the UI components.

I will now start by modifying the apps/agents/src/reflection/index.ts file to disable the reflection generation.
